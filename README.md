## **Overview**  

Satellites have transformed our ability to monitor large-scale environmental and societal issues. However, traditional satellite systems often require significant infrastructure, expertise, and financial investment, making them less accessible to smaller organizations or localized projects.  

To address these limitations, **CanSat technology**—miniaturized, cost-effective satellites—offers a flexible and affordable solution. CanSats can be launched into the near-space environment to gather essential localized data, test sensors, and simulate space conditions. By combining the high-level capabilities of traditional satellites with the adaptability of CanSats, this framework provides a powerful tool for obtaining accurate, real-time data.  

This repository serves as a **comprehensive guide and implementation toolkit** for deploying the Satellite-Powered Framework. It covers everything from system setup and data collection to processing and analysis using AI-driven tools, ensuring that users of all expertise levels can effectively leverage this innovative technology.
